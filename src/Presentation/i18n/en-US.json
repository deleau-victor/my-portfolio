This project was born from the observation that no app existed to guide visitors during their stay for the commemorations. Connected to official data streams from tourism offices and local partners, DDay Live meets a critical need for communication and information about this event.\nAs the project manager and backend developer, I led the creation of this app with the goal of significantly enhancing the visitor experience.\nðŸ”¥ **Impact:*/* The app has been downloaded by nearly 10% of visitors, with mostly positive feedback, which led to the decision to continue its development for future years.",
         "RoleOverview": "I led and was involved in the end-to-end creation process, from design to production. This included choosing the software architecture, designing the entire data flow that powers the app, and contributing to the development of part of the user interface.",

               "Problem": "The Manche department, where the Normandy D-Day events take place, is largely rural. The network infrastructure is often inadequate to support a high volume of simultaneous connections due to the influx of visitors. Additionally, network jammers may be used during visits from important figures, making it challenging to ensure a stable connection for app users.",
               "Solution": "To address this issue, we implemented a local caching system for the app's data, allowing for offline usage. The app automatically updates as soon as an internet connection is available."

               "Problem": "The app's data comes from multiple sources, such as tourism offices, local partners, and the client itself. With heterogeneous data streams and varying maintenance frequencies, it was difficult to ensure optimal consistency and availability.",
               "Solution": "To guarantee data consistency and availability, I set up a centralized data server that retrieves and normalizes data from all sources before redistributing it to app users."

The design deadlines were tight, with user testing scheduled five months after the project's kickoff, in March 2024, and a release set for May 2024 for the D-Day commemorations.",
               "Solution": "To meet these deadlines while ensuring maximum efficiency, I opted for a simple yet robust software architecture based on the Flutter framework. This allowed us to develop a single app for both iOS and Android platforms."
